attempt to build a book/reading tracker application for personal use and for practice, using ports and adapters architecture, challenging myself to do it without using gen AI in any way.

the goal is to implement many ways to use it, be it via terminal, http or even desktop gui without the need to change the domain logic, and by the end, use it as a personal log of books that i've read.

as of now, i'm testing it via http and it's saving data in an H2 database.

i want to make it at least have: books CRUD, log entries CRUD, completely useable in terminal, design a simple desktop gui, try and make a front-end for it (which i've never worked with).

maybe in the future, make it work as a game and music albums tracker too.
