attempt to build a book/reading tracker application for personal use and for practice, using ports and adapters architecture.

the goal is to implement many ways to use it, be it via terminal, http or even desktop gui without the need to change the domain logic, and by the end, use it as a personal log of books that i've read.

as of now, it's saving data in an H2 database.

maybe in the future, make it work as a game and music albums tracker too.
